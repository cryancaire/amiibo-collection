1. When clicking "Add to wishlist" from the dashboard, the button doesnt change, allowing me to click it again and getting an error.
2. When clicking "add to collection" from the dashboard, the page shouldnt refresh, it should just change the button, as it does on other pages
3. On some mobile devices the site is zoomed out a little by default and i have to manually zoom it correctly
4. On mobile, maybe add a little bit extra padding to the bottom of the amiibo browser search results
5. Please make the search bar stay visible when scrolling.
6. Add the ability to share your wishlist or collection with others via a shareable url.
